# Modified_ResNet
Modified ResNet refers to customizations or adjustments made to the original ResNet architecture to suit specific requirements or tasks. These modifications can vary depending on the application and the goals of the researchers or practitioners.
ResNet was introduced by researchers at Microsoft in 2015 and was designed to address the problem of vanishing gradients in deep neural networks. It utilizes residual blocks, which allow the network to learn residual mappings instead of directly learning the desired underlying mappings. This makes it easier for the network to optimize and train deeper architectures.
Some common modifications include changing the number of layers, adjusting the block structures, adding or removing specific components, or incorporating additional techniques to enhance performance.
Modified ResNet architectures have been developed for various tasks and domains, such as semantic segmentation, object detection, and even for specific datasets with unique characteristics. These modifications aim to improve the model's accuracy, efficiency, or adaptability to specific challenges.
It's important to note that the term "Modified ResNet" is not a specific or standardized architecture, but rather a broad term encompassing various adaptations of the ResNet model to fit different needs and applications.
